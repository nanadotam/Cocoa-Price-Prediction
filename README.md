  Welcome to the Predictive Analytics for Cocoa Market Trends project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting cocoa prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. With the power of deep learning, we aim to forecast cocoa prices and provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the cocoa industry.

## Project Overview üí°
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to forecast cocoa prices using historical data. The primary goal is to provide stakeholders in the cocoa industry with accurate and timely price predictions to aid decision-making and strategic planning. The project involves data collection, model development, validation, testing, and creating a user-friendly interface for stakeholders.

## Dataset üìä
We use a publicly available dataset containing historical cocoa prices. The dataset includes features such as the London futures (¬£ sterling/tonne), New York futures (US$/tonne), ICCO daily price (US$/tonne), and ICCO daily price (Euro/tonne). We preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting columns to appropriate data types, and calculating moving averages and volatility measures.

## Data Preprocessing üìã
The data preprocessing involves:
- Cleaning the data by removing any missing or inconsistent values.
- Encoding categorical variables if necessary.
- Calculating moving averages (7-day, 30-day, 90-day) and volatility measures.
- Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

## Feature Engineering üîç
Feature engineering steps include:
- Creating features from the raw data, such as moving averages and volatility.
- Scaling the features using techniques like MinMaxScaler.
- Ensuring that the data is evenly distributed among training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Training üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
The LSTM model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. We trained the model on the preprocessed dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the learning rate. We used techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting. We implemented Grid Search CV to find the best hyperparameters.

## Evaluation and Optimization üìà
Once the model was trained, we evaluated its performance on the testing dataset. We computed various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the model's accuracy. We visualized the predicted cocoa prices alongside the actual prices to gain insights into the model's performance. Optimization techniques, including parameter tuning and cross-validation, were employed to enhance model performance.

   - The graph shows the training and validation loss for the LSTM model over different epochs, highlighting the model's learning curve.

#### Model Details
- **Model Architecture:** The LSTM model consists of three layers with 50 units each and a dropout rate of 0.2. The optimizer used is Adam.
- **Hyperparameters:** The best hyperparameters were found using Grid Search CV with the following values:
  - Batch size: 32
  - Dropout rate: 0.2
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Units: 50

#### Evaluation
- **Training Performance:** The model was trained for 75 epochs with early stopping to prevent overfitting. The training loss consistently decreased, indicating the model's ability to learn from the data. The validation loss, however, fluctuated slightly, suggesting some challenges in generalizing to unseen data.
- **Example Predictions:** The model's predictions were compared to the actual prices, showing a reasonable alignment with the true values.

#### Discussion
- **Strengths:** The LSTM model effectively captures long-term dependencies in the data, making it suitable for time series forecasting. The model achieved a low MSE and MAE, indicating good predictive performance.
- **Limitations:** The model's performance can vary with different hyperparameters and requires careful tuning. The validation loss fluctuations suggest potential overfitting or sensitivity to data variations.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Future work could explore alternative model architectures, such as GRU or hybrid models, and incorporate additional features like economic indicators or weather data to enhance predictive accuracy.
